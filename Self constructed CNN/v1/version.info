Network architecture:
- 4 CNN layers with kernel size 3x3 and padding = 1
- Maxpooling with kernel size = 2 and stride = 2
- 2 Linear Layer
- Dropout layer with p = 0.2
- ReLU activation function

Criterion:
- BCEWithLogitsLoss

Optimizer:
- Adam with learning rate of 1e-6

Epoch trained:
- 700

Best model:
- Training loss: 0.350259
- Validation loss with 2000 imgs: 0.359377

Test data evaluation:
- Best model with 500 epoch trained (Training Loss: 0.380647, Validation Loss: 0.381679) gives the logloss score of 1.20846
- Best model with 700 epoch trained gives the logloss score of 1.29274
