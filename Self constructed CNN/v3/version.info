Network architecture:
- 5 CNN layers with kernel size 3x3 and padding = 1
- Maxpooling with kernel size = 2 and stride = 2
- 2 Linear Layer
- Dropout layer with p = 0.2
- ReLU activation function

Criterion:
- BCEWithLogitsLoss

Optimizer:
- Adamgrad with learning rate of 1e-3

Epoch trained:
- 500

Best model:
- Training loss: 0.104639
- Validation loss with 2000 imgs: 0.190923

Test data evaluation:
- Best model gives the logloss score of 3.14254

Note:
- From the loss_plot_500 and the test data logloss, it is clear that the model has been trained too much and overfitting occurs. The best model is probably trained with about 300 epochs.
